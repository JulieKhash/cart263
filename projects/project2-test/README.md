# Project 2 - Into the Blue 

-- let your mind float the distance

Originally inspired by a boring-looking music sequencer, "Into the Blue" is an interactive multimedia program that attempts to host an image and a sound inside the same button/pad.

It is heavily process-based, truthfully unplanned, as I had to figure it out along the way. ALL YOU WILL FIND IS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OF MOMENTARY FEELINGS AND FLEETING THOUGHTS. ALL YOU NEED IS TO CATCH THEM.

I designed the audio samples and images myself. A lot of time was invested in creating the entire audio and visual composition. All the media is designed and arranged in such a way that any combination of sound and image would potentially make a suitable match. Thus, it adds playfulness and unpredictability to the interaction.

I decided to keep it simple but also complex. so I used HTML, CSS and Jquery to program the interactivity, animation effect and the sequencial automation. You enter pitch darkness and see only vertically aligned icons on the left side of the screen. You have no choice but try out what these buttons are and do. You may hover over the icons to reveal the sound/image, or may rhythmically perpetuate the appearance/disappearance of audiovisual fragments on mouse click. 

Immerse yourself in a world where there is no meaning and words, but only SENSATIONS, somewhere far and unattainable.

Huge thanks to Pippin and Sharon for their technical help on this project!!!
