# Project 1: Lestat de Lioncourt

**_ somewhere between life and death _**

"Lestat de Lioncourt" is a multimedia interactive program that revolves around the fictional character from the Vampire Chronicles series by American writer Anne Rice.

The user can experience themselves as Lestat de Lioncourt and immerse themselves in a philosophical journey about what it means to be and become a vampire, and experience the world from a vampire's point of view.

Because of the appeal of the poetic language, I appropriated the text for the voice from the film script "Interview with the Vampire".

The thoughtful synthesis of different media such as images, gifs, specific sounds, script, and a whispers, adds a mystique to the game that hypnotizes the user into the game. I carefully designed the individual objects of the scenes and the overall theme to keep the aesthetics coherent.

I tried to simplify the interaction as much as possible so that the user doesn't get frustrated over the game rules. All that is required is to click on the page and expect the voice to speak and the objects to prompt. Also, I deliberately implemented a delay time, so that the user hears the story (relatively short for each scene) and looks around before moving on to the next scene.

NOTE: The only hurdle for the program is the speech recognition technology, which may occasionally break between sentences and sound like English language teacher. Despite several attempts to solve this cryptic bug, it still remains a mystery. Hopefully, will find a solution in the future.

Other than that, I wish you a wonderful experience of initiating yourself into a vampire haha!
